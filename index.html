        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Hanzala Ahmad. I am a freshman student at the University of Windsor studying Computer Science, who is determined to perfect his craft. 
          One of many ways I do this is by taking coding courses as electives to unlock knowledge on other fields such as web design. This is my second project for this course
          using HTML and CSS where I display my work, education, and hobbies, while providing a navigation menu with my biography; basically an online portfolio.
        </p>
        <!-- Simple about me in this page with content and nav menu -->
